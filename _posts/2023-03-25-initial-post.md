# Welcome to my blog

Sometime I was on second course of university. It was 2017 year and I had a dream for launch a blog about software engineering.
I even created a blog with JavaScript and dynamic rendering from GitHub repository, but somehow I think that this is too simple and "really cool engineers" don't have such simple things on their GitHub repositories, thus I deleted that blog.

But today, I decided restore my blog and start write posts regular. I will cover my pet projects, sport and maybe some interesting aspects of my life in this blog.

# Introduction
Previously I loved to learn and use different. In this post I will just describe my thoughts about them. This will be just a fun post.

I will explain how I learned and used different programming languages with bound to dates, because this is important to understand why I chose one or another language.

# How I learned programming languages?

## C programming language - Autumn 2015

Classic language in the software engineering. I started my journey in programming from this language on first course of university. I worked with it only at home when developed console games and in university.

## Python - Spring 2016

After learning C in university I decided that I want to be programmer. I studied radio engineering, not programming, while I had some subjects related to programming, them almost were focused on embedded programming which required big background in electronics, but I was young, I didn't had money to live and I didn't like to wait, so I decided to become programmer as fast as possible and started learn Python. I learned some base construct and next exam session begins in my university, so I should hold on with learning Python until I will not pass exams. In fact Python waited for my attention during next 2 years.

## Java - Summer 2016

After finishing first course of university I went to parents home on summer holidays and I had a strict decision to use free month to learn some programming languages. I chose Java, because I already know a little bit Python, but I want to start programming Android devices. I spent 2 weeks of learning Java (experience with C and Python helped me a lot) and next I had fortuitously acquaintance with one programming manager from Seattle who completely teach me Java and some frameworks. In fact that human gave me my first job as Java programmer in October 2016. I will use Java during next 6 years in commercial programming. 

## JavaScript - Summer 2017

During work at first job and develop web applications I had some tasks not only at back-end, but also at front-end, so I learned JavaScript for solve them. Then this language will be very helpful for me to work on freelance. Also I like it syntax, especially lambdas.

## Android development - Autumn 2017

I want to describe Android development as separate topic, because it was my start in freelance development and learning new technologies. As far as I worked on startup I can work on my self too, so I decided that I can earn more money by learning Android development and develop an application for my friend who worked as freelance embedded developer and need a mobile application for brewery factory automatization. So I developed Android application for him and this was my start in freelance development.

## Python (again) - Winter 2018

After first successful project at freelance, I recognized that I can make additional money and decided to learn Python for use it in fast development of small applications. So I did it and I liked Python very much. It's the best tool for fast development. After that I use Python at my work very often.


## C++ - Spring 2018

Used for learn object oriented programming in university. I don't understand why we used it and not Java which is significantly easy to understand. I used it only in university and never return to C++ after.


## Rust - Summer 2018

I played with Rust in summer, but I didn't found how to use it in commercial development at my current position or freelance, so I successfully forgot it.

## Kotlin - Spring 2020

After COVID-19 I decided to change a job and start my new work at Ajax Systems (this is an awesome company). Main programming language for backend was Kotlin and after start my work here I learned Kotlin. It's my favorite programming language right now for JVM world.

## Clojure - Spring 2021

I played with Clojure in Spring 2021, because I listened a lot of podcasts with good words about this language. Unfortunately I didn't get an idea of this language, because it's complex, it's solves the same problems which I can solve in Kotlin, Java, Python, JavaScript and a market of jobs is not so big for Clojure. After playing with it I just truncated it, because for me another languages are more viable.

## Go - Autumn 2022

In fact I start learn Go in 2020 year, but I always hadn't time to complete learning of it, because I had some ideas of projects or something else. In Autumn 2022 I finally finished learning Go and found a job in Form3 with Go, it's awesome language.


# Programming languages comparison

OK, I explained my history of different programming languages, but let me explain differences between them and how to choose a programming language for a project. I will speak only about mainly used commercial programming languages: Java/Kotlin, Python, JavaScript, Go.

## Python

## JavaScript

# Introduction

In the previous post I explained my history with different programming languages and in this post I want to explain my thoughts about choosing next programming language for a new project.

# How to choose programming language for next project?

This question is useless in cases
1. If you have a team familiar with some language and you should deliver business solution as fast as possible.
2. If you just want some technology.

This question make sense in cases:
1. You are considering to start a new pet project with an idea to build own business.
2. Yoy are considering to start a new project in your organization.

So I will consider last two options. So main questions about choosing a programming language for next project are:
1. What a problem and how quickly should I solve in a project?
2. What a budget I have for a project?
3. What level of engineers should I have to develop and support project?
4. How it will be hard for hire new engineers?
